## Welcome to Modify

Hey there! Thanks for checking out Modify! 

Here are some tips to help you become productive **quickly**.

You can also check out [this intro video](https://youtu.be/yS6MamJOqPw).

## Configure your layout 

By default, your layout is set to live preview, with editor and preview views. 

You can configure your views using the view selector dropdowns on each pane.

## Markdown/MDX docs

The editor supports real-time collaboration on markdown (we support most of the [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) spec) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

To add a markdown file, hover over a directory in your connector's tree, hit the plus icon and create a new file. 

You can use the editor's toolbar to add markdown syntax and the palette on the right to add JSX components, diagrams and relationships. 

Once you've added some relationships, click the `Relationships` icon on the right of your repository to expand the sidebar with a graph visualising them. 

## Yaml registers

Registers are tabular data, with optional schemas, stored as yaml.

To add a register, hover over a directory in your connector's tree, hit the plus icon and create a new register.

To bootstrap your register's schema, select a template. Or add a column to start building your own.

Use the table, card or editor views to edit your register. The fields are mapped between them, keeping your data in sync as you work across views.

## Commit changes to Git

Changes to markdown and yaml files in your repo are saved to your working copy in Modify's database.

To commit changes to Git, click the repository's `Commit` button, add a commit message and select the files you want to commit. 

In Git terms, this operation stages, commits and pushes to your repo all in one. 

To inspect your commit history, hover over a file in your tree and click the `History` button. Clicking the commit hash will show a diff.

## Branch your workspace 

You can branch your workspace if: 

- You want to work in isolation from your team, or
- You are using a GitHub or Bitbucket connector and so must branch before you can edit files.

To create a workspace branch, click the repository's `Branch` button and complete the form.

Branching your workspace branches all of its connectors and their contents, including directories, files and working copy.

## Merge changes 

If you want to merge changes quickly into another branch, use the repository's merge button. 

If you want to do a multi-user review with automated checks before merging, create a review on the `Reviews` page.
