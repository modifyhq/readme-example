## Welcome to Modify!

Hey there! Thanks for checking out Modify ðŸ˜„

Here are some tips to help you become productive *quickly*.

Check out our [intro video](https://youtu.be/yS6MamJOqPw) for a 5-minute overview of the basics.

## Configure your layout 

By default, your layout is configured with text editor and preview views. 

You can configure this using the view selector dropdowns.

## Markdown/MDX docs

The editor supports real-time collaboration on markdown (we support most of the [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) spec) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

To add a markdown or MDX file, hover over a directory in your connector's tree, hit the plus icon and create a new file. 

You can use the editor's toolbar to add markdown syntax and the palette on the right to add MDX, diagrams and relationships. 

Once you've added relationships, click the Relationships icon on the right of your repository to expand the sidebar showing a graph of your workspace's relationships.

## Yaml registers

Registers are version-controlled, yaml tables that you can edit with a variety of views.

To add a register, hover over a directory in your connector's tree, hit the plus icon and create a new register.

To bootstrap your register's schema, select a template. Or add a column to start building your own.

Use the table, card or editor views to edit your register. The fields are mapped between them, keeping your data in sync as you work across views.

## Commit changes to Git

Changes to files on a workspace branch are saved to your working copy in Modify's database.

To commit changes to Git, click the repository's Commit button, select the files you want to commit and add a commit message. 

In Git terms, this operation stages, commits and pushes to your repository all in one. 

ToÂ inspectÂ your commit history,Â hoverÂ overÂ aÂ fileÂ inÂ yourÂ treeÂ andÂ clickÂ theÂ HistoryÂ icon. Clicking the commit hash will show a diff.

## Branch your workspace 

You'll want to branch your workspace if: 

- You want to work in isolation from your team, or
- You are using a GitHub or Bitbucket connector and so must branch before you can edit files.

To createÂ aÂ workspaceÂ branch, clickÂ theÂ repository's BranchÂ button and complete the form.

BranchingÂ yourÂ workspace creates a copy of Â branchesÂ all of itsÂ connectors and their contents, including directories, filesÂ and working copy.

## Merge changes 

If you want to quickly merge changes from one branch to another branch, use the repository's merge button and select a target and source branch.

If you want to do a multi-user review with automated checks before merging, create a review on theÂ ReviewsÂ page.
